# DATS6101_Final_Project
# 1. This is a little project for my DATS 6101 final. It is a phototype of data product and also my first data product.
# 2. To run this code, just download the ui.R and server.R and put these files into a same path.
# 3. Then, meeting the requirment of runing shiny, open the server.R file and click the "Run app" at the corner of the code window. Note all source files are online and do not need any futher work.
# 4. Then you can enjoy my applicaition!
